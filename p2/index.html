              <h3>I was never thinking of the digital realm. I was thinking about getting a book published or making a comic. For some reason I never thought I could or would do digital stuff. But every time I'd draw I would imagine it moving and talking in my head. Once I saw my art animated for the first time I had a major revelation! I'm a slow learner.</h3>

If you just send your artwork into some company for a graphic you never know what you're going to get. 
I also love the crispy cleanness of computers. you can really get microscopic when drawing with a Wacom tablet.</h3>
